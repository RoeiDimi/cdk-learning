# CloudFront Configuration Fix - Option 2 Implementation

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
CloudFront was configured only for S3 static assets, but users were getting HTTP 403 errors when trying to access API endpoints through CloudFront. This happened because:
1. CloudFront only had S3 as an origin
2. All requests (including API calls) were being routed to S3
3. S3 doesn't support POST requests or API endpoints

### Solution Implemented
**Option 2: Separate Static & API** - Keep CloudFront for static assets only, ensure all API calls go directly to API Gateway.

## Changes Made

### 1. CDK Stack Updates (`serverlesss_multi_person_chat_app.py`)
- Added detailed outputs with clear descriptions:
  - `ChatAppUrl`: CloudFront URL for static assets only
  - `HttpApiUrl`: API Gateway URL for ALL API calls
  - Individual endpoint outputs for easy reference
- Made it crystal clear which URL is for what purpose

### 2. Frontend Configuration (`static/config.js`)
- Created centralized configuration file
- Hardcoded API Gateway URL with clear comments
- Added note that CloudFront is ONLY for static assets

### 3. HTML Updates (`static/index.html`)
- Added config.js script tag before index.js
- Ensures configuration loads first

### 4. JavaScript Updates (`static/index.js`)
- Updated to use config.js with fallback
- Added console logging of API URL being used
- All API calls use absolute URLs to API Gateway

## Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy the updated CDK stack:**
   ```bash
   cdk deploy --profile AdministratorAccess-219400381002
   ```

2. **Note the outputs:**
   - `ChatAppUrl`: Use this URL to access the web application
   - `HttpApiUrl`: This is what gets hardcoded in config.js
   - Individual endpoints: For reference/testing

3. **Update config.js if needed:**
   - If the API Gateway URL changes, update `API_BASE_URL` in `static/config.js`
   - Redeploy to push the updated config to S3/CloudFront

## How It Works Now

### User Flow:
1. User visits CloudFront URL (for static assets)
2. Browser loads HTML, config.js, and index.js from CloudFront
3. **All API calls go directly to API Gateway** (bypassing CloudFront)
4. WebSocket connections go directly to API Gateway WebSocket endpoint

### URL Usage:
- **CloudFront URL**: Static assets only (HTML, JS, CSS)
- **API Gateway URL**: All API endpoints (/register, /login, /addMessages, /getStoredMessages)
- **WebSocket URL**: Real-time chat connections

## Testing

1. Open CloudFront URL in browser
2. Try registration - should work without 403 errors
3. Check browser console for "Using API Base URL" log
4. Verify all API requests go to execute-api domain, not CloudFront

## Architecture Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: Static assets vs dynamic API calls
- **No CloudFront Complexity**: Avoided complex multi-origin setup
- **Better Performance**: Static assets cached by CloudFront, APIs go direct
- **Easier Debugging**: Clear distinction between static and dynamic requests
